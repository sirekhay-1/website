        <pre>
            I found a love, for me
            Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
            Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
            Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

            Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            Not knowing what it was
            I will not give you up this time
            But darling, just kiss me slow
            Your heart is all I own
            And in your eyes, you're holding mine

            Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
            With you between my arms
            Barefoot on the grass
            Listening to our favourite song
            When you said you looked a mess
            I whispered underneath my breath
            But you heard it
            Darling, you look perfect tonight

            Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
            She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
            I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
            To carry love, to carry children of our own

            We are still kids, but we're so in love
            Fighting against all odds
            I know we'll be alright this time
            Darling, just hold my hand
            Be my girl, I'll be your man
            I see my future in your eyes

            Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
            With you between my arms
            Barefoot on the grass
            Listening to our favorite song
            When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
            I don't deserve this
            Darling, you look perfect tonight

            Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
            With you between my arms
            Barefoot on the grass
            Listening to our favorite song
            I have faith in what I see
            Now I know I have met an angel in person
            And she looks perfect

            I don't deserve this
            You look perfect tonight
            </pre>
